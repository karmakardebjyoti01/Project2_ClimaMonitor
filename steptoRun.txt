Steps to Run the Code
Connect the DHT11 sensor to the Arduino Uno:

VCC to 5V
GND to GND
Data pin to digital pin 2 (you can change this in the code if you use a different pin)
Install the DHT library:

Open the Arduino IDE
Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...
Search for "DHT sensor library" by Adafruit and install it
Upload the code:

Copy the code above into a new Arduino sketch
Upload the sketch to your Arduino Uno
Open the Serial Monitor:

Go to Tools > Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE
Set the baud rate to 9600
You should see the temperature and humidity readings from the DHT11 sensor displayed on the Serial Monitor. If there are any errors, they will also be displayed.
